DOCUMENT
a. Either party to this Agreement, or any subsequent holder, may, at its sole election require that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy
for resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this section 21 (the "Arbitration Provision"), unless you opt out as
provided in section 21(b) below. As used in this Arbitration Provision, "Claim" shall include any past, present, of future claim, dispute, or
controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and us and/or any subsequent holder (or
persons claiming through or connected with us and/or the subsequent holders), on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any Loan Agreement and Promissory Note(s), the Site, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from
any of the foregoing, including (except to the extent provided otherwise in the last sentence of section 21(f) below) the validity or
enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether
they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims
include matters arising as initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise. The scope of this Arbitration Provision
is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.

b. You may opt out of this Arbitration Provision for all purposes by sending an arbitration opt out notice to WebBank, c/o LendingClub
Corporation, 71 Stevenson St., Suite 1000, San Francisco CA, 94105, Attention: Legal Department, which is received at the specified
address within 30 days of the date of your electronic acceptance of the terms of this Agreement. The opt out notice must
clearly state that you are rejecting arbitration; identify the Agreement to which it applies by date; provide your name, address, and social
security number; and be signed by you. You may send an opt out notice in any manner you see fit as long as it is received at the specified
address within the specified time. No other methods can be used to opt out of this Arbitration Provision. If the opt out notice is sent on your
behalf by a third party, such third party must include evidence of his or her authority to submit the opt out notice on your behalf.

c. If a Claim arises, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you
with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. You agree that before filing any claim in arbitration, you may submit
