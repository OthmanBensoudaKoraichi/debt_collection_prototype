Registration of Note Owners.

I have appointed LendingClub as my agent (in such capacity, the "Note Registrar") for the purpose of maintaining a book-entry system (the
"Register") for recording the names and addresses of any future owner of beneficial interests in this Note (the "Note Owners") and the
principal amounts and interest on this Note owing to each pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time. The person or persons identified
as the Note Owners in the Register shall be treated as the owner(s) of this Note for purposes of receiving payment of principal and interest
on such Note and for all other purposes. With respect to any transfer by a Note Owner of its beneficial interest in this Note, the right to
payment of principal and interest on this Note shall not be effective until the transfer is recorded in the Register.

Miscellaneous,

Lender may, without notice to Borrower, assign all of its right, title and interest in this Note to any other third party, and Borrower further
understands, acknowledges and agrees that any assignee may sell, assign or transfer the Note and all associated documents and
information related to the Note without Borrower's consent or delivery of notice (subject in each case to the registration requirement above).
Borrower may not assign this Note without the prior written consent of Lender. This Note inures to the successors, permitted assigns, heirs
and representatives of Borrower and Lender.

Borrower hereby waives demand, notice of non-payment, protest, and all other notices or demands whatsoever, and hereby consents that
without notice to and without releasing the liability of any party, the obligations evidenced by this Note may from time to time, in whole or part,
be renewed, extended, modified accelerated, compromised, settled or released by Lender,

Any changes to this Note must be in writing signed by Borrower and Lender. Notices will be provided electronically to Borrower's account,
unless Borrower has opted out of electronic delivery and then will be mailed to the addresses then on record.

This Note is subject to the arbitration provisions of the Borrower Agreement between Lender and Borrower, which is incorporated by
reference into this Note.
