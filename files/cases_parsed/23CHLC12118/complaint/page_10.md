designees as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name,
place and stead, in any and all capacities, to complete and execute the Loan Agreement and Promissory Note(s) in the form attached as
Exhibit A that reflect- the accepted terms set forth in each of your final Truth in Lending Disclosure(s) as such may be posted from time to
time in response to your loan request(s) in the on-line account you have established with LendingClub where documents are stored and
with full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such
power as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person ("Power of Attorney" ). This Power of Attorney is limited solely
to the purpose described above and will expire automatically upon the termination of this Borrower Agreement. You may revoke this Power of
Attorney by contacting us at support@lendingclub.com or calling 888-596-3157 and closing your account with us; provided, however, if a
loan request has been approved you must provide such notice before the loan proceeds are transferred to your Designated Account and
before the Loan Agreement and Promissory Note is executed on your behalf. Once the Loan Agreement and Promissory Note is signed by
LendingClub or its designee acting as your attorney-in-fact, it is deemed executed on your behalf and shall be your valid and binding
obligation thereafter.

You agree and acknowledge that LendingClub is an intended third- party beneficiary of this Section 6 for purposes of
receiving a loan from us.

If you choose to revoke this Power of Attorney prior to execution, we will be unable to proceed with your loan request and your pending loan
request will be considered withdrawn, your account closed, and you may be prohibited from posting additional qualifying loan requests in the
future in our discretion.

You may cancel your application without any fee or penalty prior to funding of the loan, as long as you provide us with sufficient advance
notice to stop the loan funding.
