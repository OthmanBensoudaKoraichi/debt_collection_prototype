accrued interest, and the balance on account of outstanding principal; provided, however, that after an Event of Default (as defined below),
payments will be applied to Borrower's obligations as Lender determines in its sole discretion.

Origination fee. If this loan is subject to an origination fee, such fee is deducted from the loan proceeds and paid to the
Lender. Any origination fee of 5% or less is not refundable regardless of when, or if, the loan is paid in full. Any origination
fee amount in excess of 5% is refundable on a prorated basis over the term of the loan when and if the loan is paid in full
prior to its maturity date. A partial pre-payment will not result in the refund of any origination fee amount. Borrower
acknowledges that the origination fee is considered part of the principal of Borrower's loan and is subject to the accrual of
interest.

Insufficient funds fee. If a payment is returned or fails due to insufficient funds in the designated account, Borrower may be charged a fee of
$15, to the extent permitted by applicable law. An insufficient funds fee may be assessed no more than once for a single failed payment. The
bank that holds Borrower's deposit account may assess its own fee in addition to the fee assessed under this Note.

Late fee, If any part of Borrower's payment, other than payments owed for any fee(s) assessed on a prior monthly payment, is more than 15
days late, a late fee may be charged in an amount equal to the greater of 5% of the outstanding payment of $15, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Only one late fee may be charged on each late payment. Any check payment received after 12:30 P.M., Mountain
Time, on a banking day is deemed received on the next succeeding banking day. Borrower authorizes Lender, and its successors
and assigns, to deduct any fees due by ACH transfer's Initiated to the deposit account on file for Borrower.

Prepayments and Partial Payments. Borrower may make any payment early in whole or in part, without penalty or premium at any time. Any
partial prepayment will be credited against the loan balance as described in the Payments section above. Any partial repayment does not
postpone the due date of any subsequent monthly payment, unless expressly agreed to in writing. If Borrower prepays this Note in part,
Borrower agrees to continue to make regularly scheduled payments until all amounts due under this Note are paid. Lender may accept late
payments or partial payments, even though marked "paid in full", without losing any rights under this Note. Any regularly scheduled monthly
installment of principal and interest that is received by Lender before the date it is due shall be deemed to have been received on the due
date solely for the purpose of calculating interest due.

simultaneously received by all parties.

Loan Charges. If a law that applies to the Loan and sets maximum loan charges is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan
charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced
by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower that exceeded
permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under this Note or by
making a direct payment to Borrower.
