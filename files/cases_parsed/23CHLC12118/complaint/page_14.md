For value received, I (referred to herein as "Borrower" which for purposes of this Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the "Note") includes
all parties obligated hereunder, including any joint applicant/co-borrower) promise to pay to the order of WebBank or any subsequent holder
("you" or "Lender") of this Note the principal sum of
($
) Dollars with interest as set forth below. Borrower
intends to be legally bound by this Note. Borrower has read, understood, and agreed to all of the terms of this Note.

Interest Rate, This Note bears interest during each calendar month from the date hereof until paid in full, at a fixed rate of
(%) per
annum.

Interest Calculation Method. Interest is calculated dally on the basis of a 360-day year with 12 months each of which is 30 days (or 30/360)
long, regardless if a month has more or fewer than 30 days. This Note shal bear interest on any overdue installment of principal and, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, on any overdue installment of interest, at the interest rate stated and as calculated above.

Payments. Principal and interest is to be paid during and throughout the period of
months in the following manner:
Payments of principal and interest in the amount of
($
Dollars are to be made by the Borrower to the Lender
commencing
20_, and on the same day of each successive month thereafter until
20_, when the full amount
of unpaid principal, together with unpaid accrued interest is due and payable. If the monthly anniversary is on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the
month, and the following month does not have a 29th, 30th, or 31st day, the monthly payment will be due on the last day of the month in
which the payment was due.

A PHOR TATIVE
Borrower's last payment might be of a different amount, which could be higher than the monthly installment amounts, to adjust for rounding
and/or due to calculation of daily interest charges in certain instances such as a payment due date change or Borrower making a payment
after the payment due date. In such cases, the amount of the last monthly payment will be adjusted by the amount necessary to repay the
ioan in full.
All payments on this Note are to be made in immediately available lawful money of the United States.

Borrower may make loan payments either by check, subject to any applicable check processing fee, or Borrower may authorize any Lender
to debit Borrower's designated account by ACH transfer each month. The debit amount may be a range of payments, which would include
your monthly principal and interest, and fees, if any. Borrower is responsible for ensuring that all names, account, routing or other similar
information provided by Borrower to Lender for accounts that Borrower is directing Lender to deliver loan proceeds to ("Directed Accounts")
are accurate and complete. Borrower agrees to hold Lender and LendingClub harmless for any alleged or actual loss, claim, fee or other
damage or expense Borrower may suffer related to the failure of a Directed Account to receive such proceeds if such failure was the result
(directly or indirectly) of any error in any name, account, routing or other similar information provided by Borrower to Lender. Borrower
acknowledges that neither Lender nor LendingClub has any obligation to confirm or investigate the accuracy or completeness of the
information Borrower has provided. Borrower further agrees that if the loan proceeds are rejected by a Directed Account that is not
Borrower's designated bank account, then Lender may deliver the loan proceeds into the designated bank account to satisfy our obligation
of loan proceed delivery. In all events under this section interest wil begin to accrue as of the date of issuance of the loan and not
upon the actual receipt of proceeds by Borrower or any other designated third party. If we are unable to deliver any portion of the loan
proceeds to the Directed Account(s) or Borrower's designated bank account after 14 days from the initial delivery attempt, the loan will be
canceled and only in this circumstance will Borrower not owe any interest on the loan. For avoidance of doubt, if partial loan proceeds (any
amount above $0) are delivered to the Directed Account(s) or Borrower's designated bank account, then the loan will not be canceled. If we
are only able to deliver partial loan proceeds to the Directed Account(s) or Borrower's designated bank account after 14 days, we will apply
the undelivered portion to the outstanding balance in accordance with our normal payment application procedures.

If Borrower elects to make payments by automatic withdrawal, Borrower has the right to stop payment of these automatic withdrawals or
revoke prior authorization for automatic withdrawals by notifying Lender and LendingClub of the exercise of its right to stop a payment or
revoke authorization for automatic withdrawals no less than three (3) banking days before Borrower's next payment due date.

If Borrower elects to make payments by check, Borrower must send the check either by regular mail or by overnight mail or UPS delivery to
Wells Fargo Lock Box Services, Dept #34268, 3440 Walnut Ave, Window H, Fremont, CA 94538. There will be a $7 check processing fee
per payment, subject to applicable law. Borrower may change its payment method by contacting support@lendingclub.com.

Borrower's payment method and any necessary authorization do not affect its obligation to pay when due all amounts payable on the Note,
whether or not there are sufficient funds in the applicable deposit account. The foregoing authorization is in addition to, and not in limitation
of, any rights of setoff Lender may have.

All payments are to be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts due (excluding principal and interest), then to
