applicant/co-borrower) and WebBank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank ("we," or "us"). This Agreement governs the process by which you
may make a request or requests for a loan from us through the website Lendingclub.com, including any subdomains thereof, or other
application channels offered by us (collectively, the "Site") and operated by LendingClub Corporation ("LendingClub"). If you make a loan
request, and if that request results in a loan that is approved and issued by us, then your loan will be governed by the terms of the Loan
Agreement and Promissory Note, which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A, and as it may be revised from time to time. The version
in effect when you make a loan request will apply to any loan made in response to that request, and any secondary loan would be governed
by the terms of the document then in effect. This Agreement will remain in effect for the applicable loan, and will terminate if your loan request
is cancelled, withdrawn, or declined.

BY ELECTRONICALLY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE SIGNIFIED YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS.
