The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") or Judicial Alternatives and Mediation
Services ("JAMS"). The arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the location of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance
with, the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any
countervailing law. If you have any questions concerning the AAA or would like to obtain a copy of the AAA arbitration rules, you may call
1(800) 778-7879 or visit the AAA's web site at: www.adr.org. If you have any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the
JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their web site at: www.jamsadr.com. In the case of a conflict between the rules
and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless all
parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply.

d. If we (or the subsequent holder) elect arbitration, we (or the subsequent holder, as the case may be) shall pay all the administrator's
filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing
fees) shall be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the
administrator's rules. We (or the subsequent holder as the case may be) shall pay the administrator's hearing fees for one full day of
arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator's rules
or applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we (or the subsequent holder) pay them and we agree (or the subsequent holder
agrees) to do so. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you
the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

e. Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected
according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days
after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any
appeal shall be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator's rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding.
Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any
appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and may be entered as a judgment in any count of competent jurisdiction.

f. We agree not to invoke pur right to arb trate an individual Claim you may bring in Small Claims Court or an equivalent court, if any, so long
as the Claim is pending only in that court, NO ARBITRATION SHALLPROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS
(INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT
OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS
REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the
arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the
same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an
award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration,
and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other
than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party, No administrator or arbitrator
shall have the power of authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this section 21(f), and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy,
arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this section 21(f) shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.

g. This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by and enforceable
under the FAA. The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may
award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration
Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator shall take
steps to reasonably protect confidential information.

h. This Arbitration Provision shall survive (i) suspension, termination, revocation, closure, or amendments to this Agreement and the
relationship of the parties and/or LendingClub; (ii) the bankruptcy or insolvency of any party or other person; and (iii) any transfer of any loan
or Loan Agreement or Promissory Note(s) or any other promissory note(s) which you owe, or any amounts owed on such loans or notes, to
any other person or entity. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than section 21(f) is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If an arbitration is brought on a class,
representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in section 21(f) are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last
sentence of section 21(f) to be unenforceable, then no arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be deemed to authorize an
arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY,
BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THE
PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE
OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY PARTY.
