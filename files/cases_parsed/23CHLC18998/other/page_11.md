hearing, called "discovery." Other rights that the Parties might have in court might not be available in
arbitration. Following the hearing, the Arbitrator will issue an award. The Arbitrator's decision is final, and a
court may then enforce the award like a court judgment. Courts rarely overturn an Arbitrator's award.

E.
Pre-Arbitration Resolution: Prior to starting arbitration, I can call you at (650) 204-1000 or
write to you at Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070 to attempt to resolve the
Dispute. We will try to resolve the Dispute. If you make a written offer ("Settlement Offer"), I may reject it
and arbitrate. If we do not resolve the Dispute, either party may start arbitration. No party will disclose
settlement proposals, including a Settlement Offer, to the Arbitrator.

F. Rules and Procedures: Either party may start arbitration by mailing a notice of arbitration,
even if a lawsuit has been filed. Such notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice to
me shall be sent to the email address I provided to you in my loan application, as updated. Notice to you, your
assignees or related third parties shall be sent to Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA
94070. The Party initiating the arbitration shall set forth in the notice the nature and factual basis of the
Dispute, the names and addresses of all other Parties, the amount involved, and the specific relief requested.
The responding Party must mail a response within 45 days, and may also set forth any counter-Disputes. The
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") shall conduct any arbitration according to this arbitration clause.
The AAA arbitration rules in effect when the claim is filed apply ("AAA Rules"), except where those rules
conflict with this Arbitration Clause or any of our agreements with you. I can get copies of the AAA Rules at
the AAA's website (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879. You or I may choose te have a hearing, appear
at any hearing by phone or other electronic means, and/or be represented by counsel,

G. Class Action Waiver: The Parties agree to give up any right they may have to bring a class
action lawsuit or class arbitration, or to participate in either as a claimant. The Parties agree to give up any
right to consolidate or join any arbitration proceeding with the arbitration of others. The Parties give up the
right to serve as a private attorney general in any jurisdiction in which such procedure might be permitted. To
the extent the Parties are permitted to file small claims under Paragraph K below, the Parties agree that any
small claim may only be brought on an individual basis and that no small claim may be brought on a class or
representative basis. The Parties further agree that if a court or arbitrator decides this Paragraph G is void or
unenforceable, this arbitration clause shall be void and without effect.

H.
Punitive Damage Waiver: The Parties waive any right to seek or recover punitive and/or
exemplary damages in any Dispute, No Arbitrator shall have the power of authority to award punitive and/or
exemplary damages.

I.
Fees and Costs: If I request, you shall advance all of the Arbitrator's fees and expenses, as
well as all administrative and filing fees, up to an amount of $1000. The Parties shall be responsible for their
own attorneys' fees associated with any arbitration, unless otherwise allowed for under applicable substantive
law and awarded by the Arbitrator. If the Arbitrator awards me funds, I will not have to reimburse any
arbitration fees and expenses you have advanced. If the Arbitrator does not award me funds, I agree to
reimburse you for any arbitration fees and expenses you have advanced. Any such reimbursement shall not
exceed the filings fees and costs I would have incurred had I filed a lawsuit in court.

J.
Self-Help: Notwithstanding this arbitration clause, the Parties retain the right to exercise self-
help remedies and to seek provisional remedies from a court, pending final determination of the Dispute by the
arbitrator. No Party waives the right to elect arbitration of a Dispute by exercising self-help remedies, filing
suit, or seeking or obtaining provisional remedies from a court.

K.
Exceptions:
The Parties agree that this arbitration clause is not applicable to "small
claims" meaning those claims that either Party is entitled to file and maintain in an appropriate small claims
court or any action where the total amount in controversy is no greater than $10,000, including any claims for
attorney's fees and non-monetary relief. The Parties agree that any appeal from a judgment obtained pursuant
to this paragraph shall be appealable only by arbitration according to the procedures set forth in this arbitration
clause.
