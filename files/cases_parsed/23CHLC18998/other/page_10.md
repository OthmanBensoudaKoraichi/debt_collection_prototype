report on me for any legal purpose in connection with this Note, including any update, extension of credit,
review, or collection of this loan. If I request, you will tell me whether any credit report was requested, and if
so, the name and address of the credit bureau furnishing the report. If I believe that you have information
about me that is inaccurate or that you have reported or may report inaccurate information about me to a credit
bureau, I will notify you of the specific information that I believe is inaccurate by writing to you care of
Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070. In doing so, I will identify the inaccurate
information and tell you why I believe it is incorrect. If I have a copy of the credit report that includes the
inaccurate information, I will send a copy of that report to you as well.

# NOTICE: IF I AM ARE A COVERED BORROWER UNDER THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, 10 U.S.C. § 987, THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO ME.

A.
Governing Law. I acknowledge agree that the Note involves interstate commerce and that this
arbitration clause will be construed, applied and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.,
("FAA"), as amended. The Arbitrator (defined below) shall apply applicable law and applicable statutes of
limitation consistent with the FAA and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.

B. Dispute: "Dispute" means any action, dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind arising out
of, in connection with or in any way related, even indirectly, to the Note or the extension of credit set forth in
the Note. For example, "Dispute" includes claims related to: any relationship resulting from, or activities
connected to this Note; my application; information I have provided to you; information and disclosures you
have provided to me; any prior agreements between you and me; extensions; renewals; refinancings; payment
plans; underwriting, servicing; collections; privacy; and customer information. The term "Dispute" also
includes: claims under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims in fort of contract; claims under
statutes or common law; claims at law or in equity; other past, present or future claims, counterclaims, cross-
claims, third party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and any claim relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of this arbitration clause, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration
clause, except paragraph G below, is void, voidable or unconscionable.

C. Mandatory Arbitration: Unless otherwise stated in this arbitration clause, any "Dispute"

assignees or related third parties, including Upstart, any other subsequent holder of my Note, and their
affiliates, subsidiaries, and parents, (the "Parties"), be resolved by a neutral, binding arbitration, and not by a
court of law. This procedure includes any Dispute over the interpretation, scope, or validity of this Note, this
arbitration clause or the arbitrability of any issue, with the sole exception of the Parties' waiver of any right to
bring a class action or to participate in a class action as provided for under paragraph G below shall be solely
determined by the appropriate court, if necessary. This arbitration clause applies to the Parties, including their
respective employees or agents, as to all matters which arise out of or relate to this Note or are in any way
connected with the extension of credit set forth in this Note, or any resulting transaction or relationship.

D. Facts About Arbitration: In arbitration, a neutral third party ("Arbitrator") resolves
Disputes, instead of a judge or jury. I, with you, waive the right to go to court. The Arbitrator will conduct a
hearing, which is private and less formal than a court trial. Each side will have the opportunity to present some
