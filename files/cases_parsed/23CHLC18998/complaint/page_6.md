FinWise Bank
756 E. Winchester Street Suite 100
Murray, Utah 84107

1\.
Promise to Pay. For value received from Fin Wise Bank, a Utah state-chartered bank located in
Murray, Utah ("FinWise," or "you"), I promise to pay to the order of FinWise or any subsequent holder or
assignee of this Note, the principal sum of $2, 800 , together with interest thereon commencing on the
origination date at the rate of _29.07% per annum simple interest. I acknowledge that I have read and
agree to be bound by the agreement to arbitrate all claims in Section 17 below unless I have rejected the
provision as provided in Section 17. By completing and submitting my loan application, I am requesting a
loan on the terms described in this Note. I understand and agree that when you receive my application and this
signed Note you are not agreeing to lend me money and you have the right not to make a loan to me. I
understand that I am not bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Note until you have funded a Loan.
If you decide to make a Loan to me, I agree to be bound by the terms of this Note.

2\.
Payments. This Note is payable in 36 monthly installments of
$117.44 each,
consisting of principal and interest, commencing on _Jul 15, 2021
and continuing on the
same day of each successive month thereafter until the final payment date of_Jun 15, 2024 ,which
is the maturity date of this Note. If the payment due date is on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, and the
following month does not have a 29th, 30th, or 31st day, the monthly payment will be due on the last day of
the month in which the payment was due unless otherwise notified in writing. The final payment will consist
of the then-remaining principal, unpaid accrued interest and other charges due under this Note. All payments
will be applied first to any unpaid fees incurred as a result of failed automated payments or returned bank
drafts or checks, as provided in Section 4 below; then to any late charges then due; then to any interest then
due; and then to principal. Although the principal amount of my loan includes the origination fee, no unpaid
interest or other charges will be added to principal.

3\.
Interest. Periodic interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of principal has
been paid. Interest under this Note will accrue on a daily basis on the unpaid principal balance (including my
origination fee) set forth above. Because of the accrual of interest on any late payments and the effect of
rounding, my final payment may be more (or less) than my regular payment. I acknowledge that if I make my
payments after the scheduled due date, this Note will not amortize as originally scheduled, which may result in
a substantially higher final payment amount. The interest rate I will pay will be the rate I will pay both before
and after any default unless and until my loan is charged off.
