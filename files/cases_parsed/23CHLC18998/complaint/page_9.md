11\.
Waivers. Unless I am a "covered borrower" under the Military Lending Act, 10 U.S.C § 987, even if,
at a time when I am in default, you do not require me to pay immediately in full, you will still have the right to
do so if I am in default at a later time. Neither your failure to exercise any of your rights, nor your delay in
enforcing or exercising any of your rights, will waive those rights. Furthermore, if you waive any right under
this Note on one occasion, that waiver will not operate as a waiver as to any other occasion. Subject to
applicable laws, I waive presentment, notice of dishonor, protest and all other demands and notices in
connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance or enforcement of this Note.

12\.
Assignment. I am not allowed to assign any of my obligations under this Note without your written
permission. I understand that you do not have to give me permission. I agree that you may assign or transfer
this Note or any of your rights to another person or entity. You may take these actions without notice or
consent from me. Any sale or transfer of my Note does not affect my rights and duties under this Note.

13\.
Registration. You and I appoint Upstart Network, Inc., ("Upstart") to act as a non-fiduciary agent.
Upstart will keep at its offices an electronic register of any transfer, assignment or sale of this Note (the
"Register"). The names and address of any person entitled to payments on my Note will be recorded in the
Register. Any assignment, participation or transfer of this Note or any of its rights shall be registered in the
Register and only if Upstart receives a signed assignment or similar agreement in a reasonably acceptable. You
and I agree that beneficial ownership of all payments under my Note as reflected in the Register will be
conclusive. Upstart will give me notice of a change in ownership of my Note reflected in the Register if
required by law. Upstart will also give me notice if I pay by check and the transfer changes the address to
which I must make payments. The name of the owner in the Register shall be available to me upon written
request to Upstart. This Section is intended to result in this Note being maintained at all times in "registered
form" as defined by U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.871-14(c) and Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and will be interpreted and applied in a way that is consistent
with these laws.

expressly agreed to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures

unsolicited. You may contact me at such addresses or numbers (including cell phone numbers and landlines)
