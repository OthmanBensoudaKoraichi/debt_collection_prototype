<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Fee</th>
<th>Frequency</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Origination Fee</td>
<td>8.0% of the Loan Amount</td>
<td>One time</td>
<td>This is a one-time fee and, except as provided in Section 10, is non-refundable. You will deduct from the loan proceeds before they are delivered to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Late Payment Fee</td>
<td>The greater of 5% of past due amount or $15</td>
<td>Per occurrence</td>
<td>If I do not pay you the full amount of any monthly payment within 10 calendar days of its due date, you may charge me a late fee. Any payment received after 3:00 PM Pacific time on a business day is deemed received on the next business day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACH Return or Check Refund Fee</td>
<td>$15</td>
<td>Per occurrence</td>
<td>If Automated Clearing House ("ACH") transfers or checks are rejected or returned for any reason, or fail due to insufficient funds in my bank account, then you may charge this fee. Each attempt to collect a payment is considered a separate transaction, so an ACH return or check refund fee will be assessed for each failed attempt.</td>

I authorize you to collect these fees using ACH transfers initiated by you from my designated bank account if I
have chosen this method of payment (see Section 6). Any fees you assess are immediately due. I
acknowledge and agree that the origination fee is part of my loan principal.

Proceeds. I agree that the proceeds of my loan will be paid via an electronic fund transfer into the
deposit account I have identified in my loan application, or in such other manner as you determine. I
acknowledgement that the timeliness of crediting proceeds to this account is dependent on the accuracy of the
information I provide, when I complete all origination activities, and prompt crediting by the financial
institution that holds my account. You are not responsible for the actions of the financial institution that holds
my account.

Method of Payment. I agree to pay the principal, periodic interest and any fees on this Note when

transfer from my bank account that I have authorized to automatically recur, (ii) by an ACH transfer initiated
by me each month, or (ii) personal check by regular mail to Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San
Carlos, CA 94070 or any subsequent creditor that I am notified of. If I have completed an ACH bank transfer
authorization, then you will automatically transfer my first payment in the amount specified in the
