Important Messages

Paying Interest: You have a 24 to 30 day interest-free period for Purchases provided you have paid your
previous balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly Account statement. In order to
avoid additional INTEREST CHARGES on Purchases, you must pay your new balance in full by the
Payment Due Date shown on the front of your monthly Account statement.

There is no interest-free period for transactions that post to the Account as Advances or Balance Transfers
except as provided in any Offer Materials. Those transactions are subject to interest from the date they post
to the Account until the date they are paid in full.

submit a dispute by writing to us. In order for us to assist you with your dispute, you must provide your
