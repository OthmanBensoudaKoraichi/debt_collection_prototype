Important Messages

Paying Interest: You have a 24 to 30 day interest-free period for Purchases provided you have paid your
previous balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly Account statement. In order to
avoid additional INTEREST CHARGES on Purchases, you must pay your new balance in full by the
Payment Due Date shown on the front of your monthly Account statement.

There is no interest-free period for transactions that post to the Account as Advances or Balance Transfers
except as provided in any Offer Materials. Those transactions are subject to interest from the date they post
to the Account until the date they are paid in full.

If you believe we have inaccurately reported information to any Consumer Reporting Agency, you may
submit a dispute by writing to us. In order for us to assist you with your dispute, you must provide your
name, address, phone number, account number, the specific information you are disputing, the explanation
of why it is incorrect, and any supporting documentation (e.g., affidavit of identity theft), if applicable, to:

U.S. Bank National Association
Consumer Recovery Department
Attn: CBR Disputes
P.O. Box 108
St Louis, MO 63166-0108

Your account is seriously past due. We have very attractive settlement and reduced interest/payment
programs. We urge you to call us at 1-877-838-4346.
