What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement

If you think there is an error on your statement, please call us at the telephone number on the front of this statement, or write to us at:
Cardmember Service, P.O. Box 6335, Fargo, ND 58125-6335.
In your letter or call, give us the following information:
Account information: Your name and account number.

Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.

Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error,
the following are true:

We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.

The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine
that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.

While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.

We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1\. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must
have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you,, or if we
own the company that sold you the goods or services.)

2\. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses
your credit card account do not qualify.

3\. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Cardmember Service, P.O. Box
6335, Fargo, ND 58125-6335

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our
decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay we may report you as delinquent.
Important Information Regarding Your Account

1\. INTEREST CHARGE: Method of Computing Balance Subject to Interest Rate: We calculate the periodic rate or interest portion of the
INTEREST CHARGE by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate ("DPR") by the Average Daily Balance ("ADB") (including new
transactions) of the Purchase, Advance and Balance Transfer categories subject to interest, and then adding together the resulting interest
from each category. We determine the ADB separately for the Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfer categories. To get the ADB in
each category, we add together the daily balances in those categories for the billing cycle and divide the result by the number of days in the
billing cycle. We determine the daily balances each day by taking the beginning balance of those Account categories (including any billed but
unpaid interest, fees, credit insurance and other charges), adding any new interest, fees, and charges, and subtracting any payments or
credits applied against your Account balances that day. We add a Purchase, Advance or Balance Transfer to the appropriate balances for
those categories on the later of the transaction date or the first day of the statement period. Billed but unpaid interest on Purchases, Advances
and Balance Transfers is added to the appropriate balances for those categories each month on the statement date. Billed but unpaid
Advance Transaction Fees are added to the Advance balance of your Account on the date they are charged to your Account. Any billed but
unpaid fees on Purchases, credit insurance charges, and other charges are added to the Purchase balance of the Account on the date they
are charged to the Account. Billed but unpaid fees on Balance Transfers are added to the Balance Transfer balance of the Account on the
date they are charged to the Account. In other words, billed and unpaid interest, fees, and charges will be included in the ADB of your
Account that accrues interest and will reduce the amount of credit available to you. To the extent credit insurance charges, overlimit fees,
Annual Fees, and/or Travel Membership Fees may be applied to your Account, such charges and/or fees are not included in the ADB
calculation for Purchases until the first day of the billing cycle following the date the credit insurance charges, overlimit fees, Annual Fees
and/or Travel Membership Fees (as applicable) are charged to the Account. Prior statement balances subject to an interest-free period that
have been paid on or before the payment due date in the current billing cycle are not included in the ADB calculation.

2\. Payment Information: You must pay us in U.S. Dollars with checks or similar payment instruments drawn on a financial institution located
in the United States. We will also accept payment in U.S. Dollars via the Internet or phone or previously established automatic payment
transaction. We may, at our option, choose to accept a payment drawn on a foreign financial institution. However, you will be charged and
agree to pay any collection fees required in connection with such a transaction. The date you mail a payment is different than the date we
receive that payment. The payment date is the day we receive your check or money order at U.S. Bank National Association, P.O. Box
790408, St. Louis, MO 63179-0408 or the day we receive your electronic or phone payment. All payments by check or money order
accompanied by a payment coupon and received at this payment address will be credited to your Account on the day of receipt if received by
5:00 p.m. CT on any banking day. Mailed payments that do not include the payment coupon and/or are mailed to a different address will be
processed within 5 banking days of receipt and credited to your Account on the day of receipt. In addition, if you mail your payment without a
payment coupon or to an incorrect address, it may result in a delayed credit to your Account, additional INTEREST CHARGES, fees, and
possible suspension of your Account. Internet and telephone payment options are available, and crediting times vary (but generally must be
made before 5:00 p.m. CT to 8 p.m. CT depending on what day and how the payment is made). If you are making an internet or telephone
payment, please contact Cardmember Service for times specific to your Account and your payment option. Banking days are all calendar
days except Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays. Payments due on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and received on those days will
be credited on the day of receipt. There is no prepayment penalty if you pay your balance at any time prior to your payment due date.
3\. Credit Reporting: We may report information on your Account to Credit Bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults on
your Account may be reflected in your credit report.
