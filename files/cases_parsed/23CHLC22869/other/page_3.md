4\. I am familiar with and trained on the mode and method by which Plaintiff's business records are created and
maintained. The records are kept in the regular course of business. It was in the regular course of business for a
person with knowledge of the act or event recorded to make the record or data compilation, or for a person
with knowledge to transmit information thereof to be included in such record. In the regular course of business,
the record or compilation is made at or near the time of the act or event.

5\. On or about 06/27/2022, LVNV Funding LLC became the successor in interest to this Account. The attached
account records were acquired and incorporated into Plaintiff's permanent business records as a result of
Plaintiff's purchase of the Account. These records are kept in the regular course of business on behalf of Plaintiff
and, along with other electronic records provided at purchase, are Plaintiff's primary source of business records
for this Account.

6\. The accuracy of such records is relied upon by Plaintiff and/or its agents in purchasing and collecting this
Account. Federal law required the original creditor to send monthly statements to the Defendant at the address
at which the Defendant advised that he/she was residing at the time that he/she established the account, or to
any subsequent address provided by the Defendant.
