See the last page of this statement for important information about how to
avoid paying interest on purchases.

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date
listed above, you may have to pay a late fee of up to $40 and your APRs may be
increased up to the Penalty APR of 29.99%.

Minimum payment warning: If you make only the minimum payment each
period, you will pay more in interest, and it will take you longer to pay off
your balance. For example:


<table>
<tr>
<th>If you make no additional charges using this card and each month you pay ...</th>
<th>You will pay off the balance shown on the statement in about ...</th>
<th>And you will end up paying an estimated total of ...</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Only the minimum payment</td>
<td>6 years</td>
<td>$2,738</td>
