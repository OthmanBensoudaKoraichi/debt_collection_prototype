I am familiar with the manner and method by which CPS, on behalf of Plaintiff,
creates and maintains its normal documents and records. The records are kept in the normal
course of business. CPS, on behalf of Plaintiff, maintains computerized account records,
including the account information that was provided to Plaintiff by CITIBANK, N.A .. The
computerized account records include the balance at the time of sale and the date of sale of the
subject account. The records are kept in the ordinary course of business by representatives of
CPS, on behalf of Plaintiff, who are charged with the duty to accurately record any business act,
condition or event on the computer with entries made at or near the time of any such occurrence

On or about January 26, 2023, Plaintiff became the successor in interest to this
Account. CPS on behalf of Plaintiff acquired and incorporated the attached account records into
its business records, which are not modified or altered, as a result of Plaintiff's purchase of the
Account. These records are kept in the regular course of business on behalf of Plaintiff, and
along with the electronic records provided at purchase, are business records maintained by CPS
on behalf of Plaintiff for this Account.

Federal law required the original creditor to furnish Defendant with periodic
statements.

The accuracy of such records is relied upon by Plaintiff in purchasing and by CPS
on behalf of Plaintiff in collecting this Account. These records are relied upon in Plaintiff's and
CPS's regular course of business.
