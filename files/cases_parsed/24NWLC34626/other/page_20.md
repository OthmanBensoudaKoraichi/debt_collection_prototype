How can | Avoid Paying Interest Charges? If you pay your New Balance in full by the due date
each month, we will not charge interest on new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If
you have been paying in full without Interest Charges, but fail to pay your next New Balance in full,
we will charge Interest on the unpaid balance, Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Special
Transfers available only with the Capital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard start on the transaction
date. Promotional offers may allow you to pay less than the total New Balance and avoid paying
interest on new transactions that post to your purchase balance. See the front of your statement for
additional information.

How is the Interest Charge Determined? Interest charges accrue from the 1) date of the
transaction, 2) date the transaction is processed or 3) first day of the billing period. Interest accrues.
daily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Any interest that has accrued during a billing
period will post to your account at the end of the billing period and will appear on your next
statement. This means you may owe interest charges even if you pay the entire "New Balance" one
month, but did not do so the previous month. For example, even if a customer pays their balance in
full on a February 26th due date, interest would continue to accrue on the balance from February.
2nd (the start of the Billing Cycle) through February 26th, and will appear on their next statement.
Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full for two
consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement. Interest
charges are added to the proper segment of your account. However, we reserve the right to not
assess interest charges.

How do you Calculate the Interest Charge? We use a method called Average Daily Balance
(including new transactions). 1. First, for each segment we take the beginning balance each day
and add in new transactions and the periodic Interest Charge on the previous day's balance. Then
we subtract any payments and credits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily
balance for each segment. However, if your previous statement balance was zero or a credit
amount, new transactions which post to your purchase segment are not added to the daily balance.
2. Next, for each segment, we add the daily balances together and divide the sum by the number of
days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for each segment. 3. At the end of
each Billing Cycle, we multiply your Average Daily Balance for each segment by the daily periodic
rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and then we multiply the result by the number of days
In the Billing Cycle. We add the Interest Charges for all segments together. The result is your total
Interest Charge for the Billing Cycle. The Average Daily Balance is referred to as the Balance
Subject to Interest Rate in the Interest Charge Calculation section of this Statement. NOTE: Due 10
rounding or a minimum Interest Charge, this calculation may vary slightly from the Interest Charge
actually assessed.

How can I Avoid Membership Fees? If a Renewal Notice is printed on this statement, you may
avoid paying an annual membership Fee by contacting Customer Service no later than 45 days
after the last day in the Billing Cycle covered by this statement to request that we close your
account. To avoid paying a monthly membership Fee, close your account and we will stop
assessing your monthly membership Fee.

How can I Close My Account? You can contact Customer Service anytime to request that
we close your account.

How do you Process Payments? When you make a payment, you authorize us to initiate an
ACH or electronic payment that will be debited from your bank account or other related
account. When you provide a check or check information to make a payment, you authorize us
to use information from the check to make a one-time ACH or other electronic transfer from
your bank account, We may also process it as a check transaction. Funds may be withdrawn
from your bank account as soon as the same day we process your payment.

How do you Apply My Payment? We generally apply payments up to your Minimum
Payment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances
with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your Minimum Payment to
the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.
