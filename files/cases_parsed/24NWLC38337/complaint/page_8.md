Bruce A. Sweeten ("Affiant") being duly sworn, deposes and says:

1\.
I am over 18 and I am the Chief Credit Officer of Comenity Capital Bank ("Seller"). In that
capacity and as part of my regular job duties, I have custody of certain business records of
Seller, routinely review such business records, and am familiar with Seller's processes for the
sale and assignment of accounts and business records, including those that are maintained in
electronic form.

2\.
Seller owns certain accounts, and maintains and records information in the records as they
relate to such accounts. I am authorized to make the statements and representations set forth in
this affidavit on behalf of Seller. The statements set forth herein are true and correct to the best
of my knowledge, information, and belief, based on either personal knowledge or review of the
business records of the Seller. If called upon as a witness, I can testify competently to the facts
contained herein.

3\.
My regular job duties include having knowledge of, and access to, business records relating to
the Accounts (as defined below). These records are kept by Seller in the regular course of
business, and it was in the regular course of business of Seller, for an employee or
representative with personal knowledge of the act, event, condition, or opinion recorded to
make memorandum or records or to transmit information thereof to be included in such
memorandum or records; and that the records were made at or near the time of the act and/or
event recorded or reasonably soon thereafter.

4\.
On or about 12/28/2022, Seller sold a pool of charged-off accounts (the "Accounts") by a
Credit Card Account Purchase Agreement to Midland Credit Management, Inc. ("Buyer"). The
original creditor at the time of charge-off was Comenity Capital Bank.

5\.
Pursuant to the sale, Seller sold, transferred, assigned, conveyed, granted, bargained, set over
and delivered to Buyer and its successors and assigns, good and marketable title to the
Accounts and any unpaid balance free and clear of any encumbrance, equity, lien, pledge,
charge, claim or security interest. I am not aware of any errors in the Accounts.

6\.
In connection with the sale of the Accounts, electronic and other records were transferred to or
otherwise made available to the Buyer (the "Transferred Records"). The Transferred Records
have been kept in the regular course of Seller's business, and were made or compiled at or near
the time of the event and recorded by (or from information transmitted by) a person
(i)with knowledge of the data entered into and maintained in Seller's business records, or (ii)
who caused the data to be entered into and maintained in Seller's business records. To the
extent that the Transferred Records include records that were prepared by a third party, they are
records that were incorporated into the records of Seller as a business record and the accuracy
of such records are relied upon by Seller in the regular course of business.
