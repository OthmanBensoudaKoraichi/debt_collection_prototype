IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED! Your Account is extremely past due and will be written off as a
bad debt at the end of this month. To avoid this, you can pay the Minimum amount shown on this
statement before the end of this month. If you are not able to pay the Minimum Payment amount, we will
still be able to assist you and prevent your account from being written off. Call us at 1-855-617-8089
(TDD/TTY 1-888-819-1918) and we will find a suitable payment before the end of this month. If written off,
the bad debt will be reported to the three major credit bureaus and our Recovery team will determine the
appropriate steps, as permitted and available under applicable law, to protect our interests.
