13\.
Pursuant to CA CIVIL ยง1788.58(b), attached as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of a
billing statement that was mailed to Defendant stating the balance due on the Account at
or around the time of charge-off.

14\.
Plaintiff acquired all right, title, and interest to the Account. To the extent that Plaintiff
acts in its capacity as successor-in-interest to the original creditor or its assigns,
references herein to Plaintiff may include Plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest.

15\.
Plaintiff has attempted to contact Defendant through several means in an effort to resolve
the Account, but has been unsuccessful. Defendant has not repaid this debt. Plaintiff
works with consumers like Defendant to find mutually acceptable solutions, often
offering discounts, hardship plans, and a variety of payment options. The majority of
Plaintiff's consumers ignore calls or letters, and some simply refuse to repay their
obligations. When this happens, Plaintiff must decide whether to pursue collection
through legal channels, including litigation such as the present action against Defendant.
Nonetheless, Plaintiff remains interested in discovering a mutually beneficial solution
through voluntary payments, if possible, in this case.

16\.
Before commencement of this action, Plaintiff informed Defendant in writing, that it
intended to file this action and that this action could result in a judgment against
Defendant that would include court costs allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure
ยง 1033(b)(2).
