Late payment warning:
If we do not receive your minimum payment by 09/20/2021 you may
have to pay up to a $38.00 late fee.

Minimum payment warning: If you make only the minimum
payment for each period, you will pay more in interest and it will take
you longer to pay off your balances. For example:


<table>
<tr>
<th>If you make no additional charges using this card and each month you pay:</th>
<th>You will pay off the balance shown on the statement in about:</th>
<th>And you will end up paying an estimated total of:</th>
