Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased
with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining
amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1\. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100
miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have
beeri more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary it your purchase
was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or il we own the company
that sold you the goods or services.)

2\. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made
with cash advances from an AIM or with a check that accesses your credit
card account do not quality.

3\. You must not yel have lully paid for the purchase.

purchase, contact us in writing; al: Comenily Capital Bank PO Box 182620,

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as
discussed above. Aller we linish our investigation, we will tell you our
decision. At that point, il we think you owe an amount and you do not pay
we may report you as delinquent.

HOW TO AVOID PAYING INTEREST. Your due date is at least 25 days alter
the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on purchases
if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. We will begin to
charge interest on new purchases made under a Low APR, Equal Payment
or Budget Payment Credit Plan from the date of purchase.

BALANCE COMPUTATION METHOD. We calculate interest separately for
each type of balance on your account using a "Daily Balance" to determine
interest charges for each billing period. We figure the interest charge on
your account by applying the periodic rate to the "daily balance" of your
account for each day in the billing cycle. To get the "daily balance" we
take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new
purchases and tees, and subtract any payments or credits (treating any net
credit balance as a zero balance), This gives us the daily balance.

CREDIT REPORTING. We may report information about your account to
credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your
account may be reflected in your credit report.
